### How is responsive design different from adaptive design?
- Both attempt to optimize UX across different devices
    - Adjusting different viewport sizes
    - resolutions
    - usage contexts
    - control mechanisms
- **Responsive design works on the principle of flexibility**
    - A single fluid website that flexes and changes based on the multitude of factors
    - By using:
        - media queries
        - flexible grids
        - responsive images
    - Setting the breakpoints could be quite challenging
        - Standardized values or customized based on our own layout?
- **Adaptive design is more of a progressive enhancement approach**
    - It detects the device and other features and then provides the appropriate feature and layout
        - Based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics 
    - This approach requires unreliable methods
        - User agent sniffing
        - DPI detection
